# Trading_model

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to learn how to handle and train models with temporal data. 
To achieve this, I will gather, process, and analyze historical data across Commodities, Volatility, Weather, Forex, and Macroeconomic indicators. The goal is to train a predictive model capable of forecasting market behavior two days in advance.

Process Overview:

Data Gathering: Collect structured datasets from diverse sources (e.g., APIs, databases).
Preprocessing:
Handle missing values (NaN), align time sequences, and normalize data.
Create features such as changes, trends, and interactions between datasets.
Model Training:
A hybrid forecasting model using LSTMs and attention mechanisms to capture cross-domain interactions and temporal dependencies.
Prediction:
Predict market direction (up/down) and magnitude of changes (strength) for the target markets two days ahead.
